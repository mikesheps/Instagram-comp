# Instagram-comp

Just turning this Instagram-comp into a static one page site as a proof of concept.


## Setting up the project
1. Clone this repo
1. Open it in a text editor and the terminal
7. Run `npm install` in the terminal to get all the dependencies
8. Then run `gulp` in the terminal. That's it!


### Gulp
The gulpfile will:
- pre-process stylus into CSS
- processed Jade templates into html
- optimize images for you
- automatically launch the browser with your project in Chrome Canary (must have Canary installed.)
- automatically refresh the browser on save
- make a list of your TODOs by running `gulp todo`

### Notes
- just a proof of concept
- no responsive settings
- could be polished more, but this is fine for now
